[The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635)

The first lottery ticket hypothesis paper.



[Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01611)

Applying lottery ticket to large-scale networks, with different tricks, e.g. weight rewinding.



[Drawing early-bird tickets: Towards more efficient training of deep networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11957.pdf)

Lottery ticket for efficient (hardware-wise) training. Tickets emerge at the early stage of the training process when large learning rates are used. Can be combined with channel-pruning/quantization.



[Successfully Applying the Stabilized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to the Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03454.pdf)

Applying stabilized lottery ticket to Transformer, i.e. the "Stabilizing" paper.
